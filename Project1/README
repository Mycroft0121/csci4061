Purpose:
	Builds executable programs or libraries from source files based on a 
	makefile. It does the Following:
	1) Reads the makefile
	2) Follows the specification in the file
	3) Builds the targets in a controlled fashion

How to Compile:
	Entering "make" in the command line compiles the program and returns an
	an executable called make4061.

How to use Program:
       	To run from the shell, first compile the program using the method
	described above. Then run the executable using the ./ command (i.e.
	"./make4061"). The program can be run with numerous flags and options 
	which are as follows:
	
	Defaults to builds first taget found in makefile
	"-f FILENAME" Read from specific FILE
	"-h" Displays help screen
	"-n" Print commands only does not eecute them
	"-B" Don't check timestamps
	"-m FILENAME" Redirect output to FILE
	"./make4061 SPECIFIC TARGET" Only builds specific target
	  
	***Make sure to specify target last when running with multiple commands,
	otherwise getopt will terminate early.***

Other Instructions:
	Be happy.
