How to compile and run your program:
	To compile and run the program, type "make" (DON'T use make clean) on the commandline 
	with the given makefile which should create an executable called "web_server". 
	In order to start running a server, type
	./web_server <port#> <path_to_files> <#dispatch> <#worker> <queuelength> 
	Where #dispatch and #worker are the number of dispatch and worker threads respectively,
	and queuelength is the size of the bounded buffer that contains requests to be
	processed. 
	To query a file from the server, type
	wget -i <path_to_files>/file   
	If the -O <filename> flag is added, all of the requested files will be put in one
	file named <filename>.

How our program works:
	Our program creates a server which will run indefinitely (until the user calls 
	ctrl+c), which can then send files stored locally to entities which query it either
	from the same machine, or from different unix machines (assuming they are on the same
	cse lab account).
